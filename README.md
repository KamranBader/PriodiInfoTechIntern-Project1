Caesar Cipher GUI
This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's tkinter library for demonstrating the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
 Features:
	Encode and Decode Modes: Choose between encoding (encryption) or decoding (decryption) a message.
	Shift Number Input: Specify the number of positions each letter in the message should be shifted.
	Visual Feedback: Displays the resulting encoded or decoded message using tkinter's messagebox.
	Terminal-Like Aesthetic: Designed with a dark background and green text to evoke a hacking or terminal-like appearance.
Usage:
1. Choose Operation: Select either "Encode" or "Decode".
2. Enter Message: Input the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter Shift Number: Enter the number of positions to shift each letter in the message.
4. Encrypt/Decrypt: Click the "Encrypt/Decrypt" button to see the result.
Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for logic and tkinter GUI.
tkinter: Python's standard GUI library for creating interactive interfaces.
GitHub: Version control and project management platform for code repository.
 How to Run:Clone the repository and run `caesar_cipher_gui.py` using Python.
Future Enhancements:
	Adding more advanced cryptographic algorithms.
	Improving the user interface with additional features and customizations.
